attributes
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rcpp11/attributes.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Rcpp11/attributes)

This is an attempt to implement [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) attributes outside of Rcpp. 

There are now several implementations of Rcpp : [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp),
[Rcpp11](https://github.com/romainfrancois/Rcpp11) and maybe soon Rcpp98. 

Attributes could serve all these implementations
